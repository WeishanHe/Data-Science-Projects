# New Feature Performance Evaluation using DID and CLV 

## Introducing an Online Community at KyngaCell

A mobile gaming firm KyngaCell requests to determine the effectiveness of their new online gaming community feature for the latest game Nicht-Soporific. This new feature aims to increase user revenue and retention. In this project, we explore the impacts of the online gaming community on the firmâ€™s revenue and retention, the evaluation of their Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), the magnitude of probable change within the explanatory variables, and took a step further to explain the campaign effectiveness. 

We applied diff in diff to measure change in user revenue and leveraged logistic regression to estimate CLV. Based on the results, the online community successfully increased revenue in the short term but failed to boost retention rate and CLV in the long run. The same ineffectiveness can also be observed in the campaign. Thus, KyngaCell should provide more incentives to improve user engagement.
