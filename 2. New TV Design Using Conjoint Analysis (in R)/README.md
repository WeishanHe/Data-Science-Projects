# New TV Design Using Conjoint Analysis 

## Conjoint Analysis of TV pricing
The company is going to launch a new TV. The DS team is required to use design matrix to conduct conjoint analysis in order to generate an optimal price. 

Conjoint analysis is a technique that helps us understand how customers value different features of a product or service. This technique allows us to determine the attribute importance, ideal product profiles, the price premium for brand names, and ultimately the optimal price in terms of profitability. This project presents the fundamental steps required to conduct conjoint analysis, followed by an actual illustration of the analysis done with our group members' data in rankings different Flat-Panel TV designs.

The following seven results are generated by the conjoint analysis function that we constructed: 
1. Partworth of each attribute level
2. Attribute Importance of each attribute
3. Willingness to pay for each non-price attribute level
4. Optimal price
5. Maximum profit
6. Plot market shares as a function of prices
7. Plot profit as a function of prices
