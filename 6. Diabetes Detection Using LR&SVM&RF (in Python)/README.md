In this project, I first conducted EDA to learn about the dataset. Then applied logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest to detect diabetes. For each model, I leverged GridSearch to optimize its hyperparameters in order to achieve better performance.

You can refer to the Jupyter Notebook for details about codes, interpretations of the results, and model performance comparison.
